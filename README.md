# NBA Final Project Report
Group Members: Andrew Vernon, Jackson Milner, Nahome Kassa


The goal of this project is to analyze NBA player data to find how a player’s physical characteristics impact their draft order, success in the league, and which performance statistics tended to be grouped together. This topic was chosen because we are all fans of basketball and we would like to get a statistical insight to the underlying factors of what makes a player valuable in the league and to be able to use these insights to make new predictions about new players.
	The dataset that we have selected contains data on all players who have been on an NBA roster from the years 1996-2019 and has 22 columns of data. The data on the players includes physical characteristics such as age, height, and weight. The data also contains the player’s country of birth, college team played for, draft year, and draft round. Player performance statistics such as the average number of points, rebounds (offensive and defensive), and assists. The dataset also includes player efficiency statistics such as shooting efficiency, rebound percentage, assist percentage, and team play percentage. 
Some initial observations about the data are as follows:
•	Contains data on over 11,000 players, so we are comfortable on the quality of data
•	Observations contain very specific information, like distinguishing between offensive and defensive rebounds and allocating a column to each of them
•	Data on players dates back to 1996, so we can take all of our conclusions from one era and compare it to another and see what’s different and what’s the same

The research questions we have decided to focus on are as follows:
•	How does the player’s college team impact his draft selection? We have seen that big name basketball schools tend to attract more talented players out of high school. With a conclusion on this research question, we want to be able to determine if where a player went to school has a significant effect on his draft position
•	How much does a player’s draft selection impact his individual game stats? We want to see if there are any trends with a player’s individual game stats and his draft position. With a conclusion on this research question, we want to be able to predict how good a player’s individual games stats will be based on his draft position.
•	How much have height, age, and weight changed over time? The sport of basketball has evolved over the years, and recently in the past 5-10 years there has been a greater emphasis on 3-point shooting. Due to the change in the sport, we are seeing more skilled players get selected ahead of taller, stronger, more physically impressive players. With a conclusion on this research question, we want to make additional insights on how valuable a player is to their team.
•	How much does a certain era affect a player’s individual game stats? As we know, the game of basketball is constantly evolving and the considered “best” way to play basketball is continually in question. We want to know how much a player’s individual game stats are affected by the era that he is playing in.
•	How much effect does draft selection impact how long a player plays in the NBA? We are interested in whether or not higher drafted players play longer on average than players drafted later or players who went undrafted.
